## App structure

I divided app on 3 classes - App, Block and Frame. App is main class where we can create new Block (this is instance for every first block with first question) and inside Block we can create sub-question with condition - and this is Frame class

-> App </br>
---> Block </br>
-----> Frame </br>
-----> Frame </br>
---> Block </br>
-----> Frame </br>
